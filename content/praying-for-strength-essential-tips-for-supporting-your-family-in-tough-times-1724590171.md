**Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)** - "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

## How can I trust God's plan for my family during challenging times?

Trusting **God's plan for your family** during difficult times can be challenging, but it is essential for maintaining faith and hope. Remember that **God is in control** and has a purpose for every situation. **Lean on God's promises** and trust that He will work all things together for good. Surrender your fears and worries to God, knowing that His plan is perfect.

**Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)** - "For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
