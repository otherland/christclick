This verse reminds us of the importance of **praying for our enemies**, even when it may be difficult.

Another **Bible verse** that emphasizes the significance of **praying for our enemies** is found in Luke 6:28, where it says, "Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you."

So, when you find yourself struggling to pray for those who have wronged you, turn to these **biblical verses** for guidance and strength.

- **Forgiveness and healing**: Praying for our enemies can not only benefit them but also help us find forgiveness and healing in our own hearts. Holding onto anger and resentment towards others can weigh us down, but through prayer, we can release those negative emotions and find peace.

## How can I bless our enemies through prayer?
